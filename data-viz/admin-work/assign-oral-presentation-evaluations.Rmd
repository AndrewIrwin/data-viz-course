Generate a list of oral presentations for students to view.

Need:

  * a gmail account, authenticated
  * the list of students, emails, github IDs, and team numbers
  * a list of teams that have submitted oral presentations

For each student generate a list of 5 oral presentations for teams other than theirs.

Write an email to each student. Queue the emails as drafts. Review emails. Send them a few hours before the exam. Do a test email to yourself a day or two early.

```{r}
number_to_view <- 5
```
