## Plan

* What is MDS and why do we use it?

* Demonstration 

* Comparison with PCA

## What is MDS?

* A tool to convert a distance or dissimilarity matrix into a set of points in a plane

* Can be based on distances (using one of many metrics) or ranks of dissimilarities, when it is called non-metric MDS (NMDS)

* NMDS suitable if you can rank objects as being closer or farther away, by the scale of the quantification is skewed or not important

## Cites on a map

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align="center"}
# knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "122-mds_files", "figure-html", "mds-map-cache-1.png"))
knitr::include_graphics("static/L22/mds-map-cache-1.png")
```

## MDS analysis

* Use latitude and longitude of cities to compute distance between each pair

* Use MDS on distance matrix to reconstruct relative positions

## Cites on a map

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align="center"}
# knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "122-mds_files", "figure-html", "unnamed-chunk-5-1.png"))
knitr::include_graphics("static/L22/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png")
```


## MDS analysis

* Use latitude and longitude of cities to compute distance between each pair

  * **How do we compute that distance? Euclidean? Great circle?**
  
* Use MDS on distance matrix to reconstruct relative positions

## Cites on a map

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align="center"}
# knitr::include_graphics(here("docs", "122-mds_files", "figure-html", "unnamed-chunk-6-1.png"))
knitr::include_graphics("static/L22/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png")
```

## How and when to use MDS?

* When you can similar pairs of objects are

  * How similar are the species in two communities?
  
  * How similar are two countries based on economic development?
  
* Columns are objects (sample locations, countries)

* Be sure the observations (rows) are all measured in the same units

  * Abundance
  * Proportions
  * Scaling or transformation may be required

## How is MDS different from PCA?

* PCA is a rotation and projection of data to select linear combinations of original variables that highlight variation

* MDS converts pairwise distance or dissimilarity matrix into relative positions

* Both make plots of points on abstract axes

  * Possibly with arrows showing direction of change of other variables


## Further reading

* Course notes


## Task

* Practice PCA and MDS methods
