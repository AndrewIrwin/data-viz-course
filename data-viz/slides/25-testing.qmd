## Plan

* Why is testing important?

* Testing data

* Testing code

* Examples

* Application in this course

## Data error

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L25/error-excel-covid.png")
```

## Computing error

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L25/testing-error-austerity.png")
```

## Why is testing important?

* Visualizations are powerful and help people draw conclusions

* Data errors and misunderstandings can corrupt your work

* Mistakes in analysis (summarize, grouping, calculations) can lead to wrong conclusions

* Checking (manually and automatically) your work improves confidence

* If you return to a project later, or give it to someone else, misunderstandings can lead to misinterpretation


## Testing data {.smaller}

* Were the data read correctly by R (numbers, text, dates, missing values)?

* Are the expected numbers of rows and columns present? Is there a way to check?

* Are any values impossible? (Negative counts or lengths.)

* Changes in units? (Lots of "outliers") Human-coded numbers (commas, spaces, scales like M, K for millions and thousands)

* Spelling errors, abbreviations, or variants? Capitalization. Extra spaces.

* Duplicated data?

* Date formatting. Times and time zones.

## How to test data?

Most powerful and easiest to use techniques:

* Summary tables: counts, means, ranges

* Simple visualizations: histograms, boxplots, scatter plots

Check the "obvious" things.

## Testing calculations

* Test your code on sample or simulated data

* Perform a part of the calculation by hand to independently check a result

* Positive and negative controls (just like experiments)

* Provide a test dataset and correct report for future users to check

## Example: Jelly bean data {.smaller}

Key variables: treatment, flavour, reaction time, accuracy.

```{r include=FALSE}
jelly <- read_csv("static/L25/jelly-bean-data.csv") |> clean_names() |> filter(!is.na(flavour)) |>
  rename(treatment = group_choose_from_drop_down)
```

```{r}
jelly |> kable() |> kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

## Example: Jelly bean data

```{r}
jelly |> count(treatment) |> kable() |> kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

## Example: Jelly bean data

```{r}
jelly |> count(flavour) |> kable() |> kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

## Example: Jelly bean data

```{r}
jelly |> count(tolower(flavour)) |> kable() |> kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

## Example: Sorting

```{r}
jelly |> count(tolower(flavour)) |> arrange(n) |>
  kable() |> kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

## Example: Histogram

```{r error=TRUE}
jelly |> mutate(reaction_time_s = as.numeric(reaction_time_in_sec)) |>
  ggplot(aes(reaction_time_s, fill = factor(accuracy_0_incorrect_1_correct))) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

## Example: Histogram

```{r error=TRUE}
jelly |> mutate(reaction_time_s = as.numeric(reaction_time_in_sec)) |>
  ggplot(aes(reaction_time_s, fill = treatment)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

## Example: Counts

```{r}
jelly |> count(accuracy_0_incorrect_1_correct, treatment) |> kable() |> kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
jelly |> mutate(reaction_time_s = as.numeric(reaction_time_in_sec)) |>
  ggplot(aes(factor(accuracy_0_incorrect_1_correct), treatment)) + geom_count()
```

## Summary: testing in this course

* We are not routinely testing data or code in this course

* You should be aware of the way errors get into analyses and that there are methods for guarding against them

* You should do some checking of the data in your term project, but it's not an assigned part of the work
