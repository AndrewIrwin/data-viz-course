## Plan

* Collaborating with GitHub and Rstudio

* How editing conflicts arise

* Resolving editing conflicts

* Other workflows

## Using the team-planning repository

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L18/collaboration-01.png")
```

## Scenario

* Two people have cloned the repository to their computer and are both editing the same file

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L18/collaboration-02-rstudio-cloud-student.png")
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L18/collaboration-02-airwin.png")
```
:::
::::


## One person pushes a change to GitHub

* What happens when the second person tries to push a change?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L18/collaboration-03-conflict.png")
```

## One person pushes a change to GitHub

* What happens when the second person tries to push a change?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L18/collaboration-03-resolution.png")
```

## Later, the other user pulls the changes

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L18/collaboration-04-result.png")
```

## Conflicting edits on the same line can't be resolved automatically

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L18/collaboration-05-conflict-1.png")
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L18/collaboration-05-conflict-A.png")
```
:::
::::


## Conflicting edits on the same line can't be resolved automatically

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L18/collaboration-06-message.png")
```

## Pull, edit, stage, commit, push

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L18/collaboration-07-resolution.png")
```

## Summary

* The pull - edit - commit - push editing workflow

* Non-conflicting "simultaneous" edits

* Conflicting simultaneous edits on the same line and how to resolve them
  * Commit to local repository
  * Pull remote changes
  * Resolve conflicts
  * Stage, commit, and push changes

## Task

* Task: 
  * Add your name to the collaboration list, as part of a team, or by yourself. 
  * People not in teams will be assigned teams randomly. 
  * Resolve any conflicts that arise -- for example, two people using the same line of the table.
