## Plan

* Finding data

* Asking questions that can be answered by data

* Reading data

* Checking data

* Subsetting data (filtering observations, selecting variables)

* Importance of metadata (source, units, how/why/when)

## Where to get data?

* R packages

* Websites: gapminder, Our World in Data, Tidy Tuesday

* Large repositories: Statistics Canada, OECD

* Specialized repositories: Many COVID data repositories

* Small collections made by individuals

* Government "Open data"

* Many, many, many more sources: google

## What to look for?

* A clear description of the data, how and why they were collected

* Downloadable spreadsheets, comma separated variables files, text files

* R packages to download data

* GitHub repositories (and others: pangaea.de, osf.io, and many, many more)

* A license or terms and conditions of reuse and redistribution

## Example: gapminder

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L19/gapminder-web-01.png")
```

## Example: gapminder

```{r message=FALSE}
electricity <- read_csv("static/L19/electricity_use_per_person.csv")
electricity %>% 
  filter(str_starts(country, "[AM]")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(`2010`, fct_reorder(country, `2010`))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Electricity use in 2010\n(annual kWh per capita)", y = "") + my_theme
```

## Example: UN

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L19/un-data-01.png")
```


## Example: UN

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L19/un-data-02.png")
```

## Example: UN

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
forest_UN <- read_csv("static/L19/UNdata_Export_20210219_185253716.csv")
forest_UN %>%
  filter(Year == 2017, Unit == "1000 ha",
         str_starts(`Country or Area`, "[BU]")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Value, y = fct_reorder(`Country or Area`, Value))) +
  geom_point() + labs(x = "Forest area (1000 ha)", y = "") + my_theme +
  scale_x_log10() + theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size=10))
```

## Our World in Data

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L19/price-lighting.png")
```

## Datapasta

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L19/datapasta-01.png")
```

## Datapasta

Addins > Paste as data.frame

)
```

## Metadata

* What data were collected? (Column definitions, units, sampling)

* Who collected the data?

* Why were the data collected? (Purpose can influence utility)

* How were the data collected? (Survey, random design or self-reported, experiment, methods)

* When and where were the data collected? (Geographic, temporal scope)

## Summary

* Highlighted a few sources of data

* Easiest case is a `csv` format file

* Many R packages have data or have functions to retrieve data

* Always examine your data to be sure it was read and interpreted correctly

* Always look for metadata: units, how was data collected, who collected data, ...

## Bonus Task

  * Find data online that you have not used before from a source in this lesson or anywhere else.
  * Download the data to your computer. 
  * Read the data into R. 
  * Make a simple plot of the data.
