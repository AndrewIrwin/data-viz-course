## Goals

* Identify characteristics of a good data visualization.

* Design, edit, and communicate with data visualizations.

* Learn computer skills needed to create visualizations.

## Learning outcomes

### Visual impact and aesthetics of graphics

- Connect data to perceptual features of your graphics.

- Describe aesthetic features of good plots. 

- Use length, shape, size, colour, annotations, and other features to enable comparative visual interpretation.

## Learning outcomes

### Visualization as communication

- Visualization as a tool for communication.
- Iterative process similar to editing text.
- Choose the right format for your audience and communications goals.
- Evaluate effectiveness by peer-review and constructive feedback.

## Learning outcomes {.smaller}

### Computing skills

- Create graphs with continuous and categorical variables with informative legends.
- Add error bars, linear models, smooths, labels, and other annotations to a graph.
- Use the principles of tidy data to help with transformation and analysis of data.
- Summarize and transform data using dplyr.
- Write reproducible reports to document your analysis process and present your results.
- Distribute data, code, and results using git and github.
- Develop skills for independently learning new data visualization methods and software.

## Learning outcomes

### Statistical models

- Approximate data with LOESS, OLS, robust regression, polynomial regression.
- Extract information from statistical models.
- PCA to reduce the dimensionality of complex datasets.
- MDS to visualize and compare similarities and dissimilarities between variables.
- Divide observations into homogeneous and distinct groups using K-means.

## Tools

* R - software for statistics
* Rstudio - a graphical interface to make using R easier
* R markdown - write reports that combine computations, results, and natural language
* ggplot - a tool for plotting data 
* git - a tool for managing your work and collaborating

## Weekly Plan
