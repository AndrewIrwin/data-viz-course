## Cloud services

-   [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)

## Why these tools and not some others?

-   Python
-   JavaScript
-   Excel, Office suite

Why is programming a computer worth the effort to learn, to use?

What about learning fundamentals instead of the specifics of one particular software package?

## Other topics get their own lessons

-   Grammar of Graphics & ggplot2
-   Tidy data: dplyr, tidyverse packages
-   Version control: git and github
