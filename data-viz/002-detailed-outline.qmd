Each lesson below has links to course notes and slides. Course notes contain further links to textbook readings and other material to help you learn. Some students will prefer to begin by attending class, others will prefer to begin with the written notes and slides. I suggest you learn which you prefer by experimentation. The tasks are designed to help you be sure you know the most important parts of each lesson.

## Course calendar {-}

This is a plan for the term. Timing of course content may change. Slides will normally appear before the class, but you can expect last-minute changes and maybe some edits after each class is over.

[Tasks](004-evaluation.qmd#tasks) are due Monday at 6:00 pm Atlantic each week. Due dates for assignment and term project component are listed below.

Slides and other materials presented in class will be posted here when they are ready.
