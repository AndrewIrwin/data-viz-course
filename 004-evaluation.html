<section id="evaluation" class="level1 unnumbered">
<h1 class="unnumbered">Evaluation</h1>
<p>All the work you will complete for evaluation and credit in the course is described below.</p>
<section id="tasks" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<p>Tasks for each lesson are described here. Each task is designed to demonstrate a particular skill or idea from the lesson or prepare for the next lesson.</p>
<p>Tasks will usually be evaluated on a 0-10 scale on the following rubric:</p>
<ul>
<li>0-5: Work missing or mostly incomplete.</li>
<li>6-7: Mostly complete or complete with major deficiencies.</li>
<li>8: Complete and meets expectations.</li>
<li>9-10: Complete and excels in some respect: engagement with the task, creativity in the thoughtful application of course skills and ideas, and organization of your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tasks are grouped by week below. I encourage you to work on all the tasks. You are only required to submit one task for grading each week (except for week 1 which has two tasks and week 3 which has no tasks). If you miss a week or want to improve your grade from an evaluated task, I will accept two tasks in up to two weeks of your choosing, starting in week 4. Simply submit two tasks those weeks and I will drop the lower grades from your other tasks.</p>
<section id="week-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="week-1">Week 1</h3>
<p>There are two tasks this week (Invitation, Setting Up). Both are to be submitted on Brightspace.</p>
<section id="task-1" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="task-1">Task: Invitation (Lesson 1)</h4>
<p>Find two data visualizations that you find informative, compelling, or in need of improvement.</p>
<p>Create a document that shows each visualization (the figure, or a snapshot of a dynamic visualization), provides the source (e.g., url and publication details if applicable). In a short paragraph describe</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the data behind the visualization,</li>
<li>main message conveyed by the visualization,</li>
<li>one or two features of the visualization that make it effective or provide suggestions for improvement.</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of this task isn’t to be right or wrong in your assessment, but rather to develop a practice of looking at data visualizations through the perspective of creator, designer, and critic. It’s okay if you find visualizations from secondary sources and not the creator or original publisher. Include the reference to the source you used to find the visualizations.</p>
<p>Submit your work as a single PDF on Brightspace.</p>
</section>
<section id="task-b1" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="task-b1">Bonus task (Lesson 2)</h4>
<p>(Not to be handed in for marks.)</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#gettingstarted">Healy, Sections 2.1-2.4</a>, which contains excellent advice on the reasons for using R markdown, R/Rstudio, projects, the basics of R, and being patient as you learn computing tasks.</p>
<p>Make a list of about 10 key takeaway messages from the reading. For example, I would start with</p>
<ul>
<li>Do all my learning and work in R in R markdown documents created with Rstudio. This is a new skill to learn, but will be worthwhile. Don’t use a word processor. Don’t cut and paste code and results from the R console into a document. It’s too easy to make mistakes this way and will take longer.</li>
<li>Take notes about what I learn (for ggplot and other skills). I’ll write these in a private Rmd document called data-viz-notes.Rmd (or something like that)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="task-2" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="task-2">Task: Setting up (Lesson 3)</h4>
<p>See the instructions in the syllabus or in Lesson 3 notes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install R, Rstudio, and the packages listed in Lesson 3.</li>
<li>Install git.</li>
<li>Create a github account.</li>
<li>Login to <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/">rstudio.cloud</a>. This is a complete R, Rstudio, and git setup “in the cloud” that can be used if you have trouble using R on your own computer. I suggest you login using your git account to link Rstudio to git.</li>
<li>Ask for help with any of these tasks if you need it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer the quiz on Brightspace which will ask if you were successful with each task or if you need help. Provide your github name in one of the quiz questions.</p>
</section>

<section id="week-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="week-2">Week 2</h3>
<p>Task 3 should be submitted on Brightspace this week.</p>
<section id="task-3" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="task-3">Task: Look at data (Lesson 4)</h4>
<p>Your task for this lesson is to answer two specific questions about choices made when visualizing data, drawing on your own experience and the ideas presented below. You should also become familiar with <a href="https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata">Healy, Chapter 1</a> which contains much more on these topics.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Some people feel very strongly about the placement of 0 on the vertical scale of plots. Look again at the carbon dioxide plots in Lesson 1. The vertical scale does not start at 0. Use the ideas in <a href="https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#problems-of-honesty-and-good-judgment">Healy, Chapter 1.6</a> to describe how you would interpret vertical position on the carbon dioxide plots and how you could interpret this position if 0 was included on the vertical scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Hans Rosling’s visualizations (as shown in Lesson 1) use many channels for conveying data: x and y position, color, size, an annotation for year in the plot background. The interactive versions use an animation for change over time, and mouse-over pop-ups to identify the country for each dot. These are very complex visualizations!</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>For Rosling’s plot show in in Lesson 1, what variables are shown for each of x and y position, color, and symbol size?</li>
<li>According to <a href="https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#channels-for-representing-data">Healy, Chapter 1</a> which of these 4 features is most difficult to make quantitative comparisons with? Why? Do you agree?</li>
<li>In your judgment, is this visualization effective or too complex? Watch the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen">TED talk</a> or experiment with the <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/">interactive version</a> before answering the question. Does the live explanation provided in Rosling’s oral presentation help you interpret the plot?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Write answers for these two questions in a word processor (we’ll start using R markdown soon) and submit as a single PDF on Brightspace.</p>
</section>
<section id="task-b2" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="task-b2">Bonus task (Lesson 5)</h4>
<p>Repeat the examples from Lesson 5 until you are comfortable with the basics of making a plot. We will learn much more about plotting starting the lesson after next. Refer to <a href="https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#make-your-first-figure">Healy, Section 2.6</a> for a different basic plot.</p>
<p>There is nothing to submit for this task.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="week-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="week-3">Week 3</h3>
<p>No assigned tasks this week. Work on Assignment 1 instead.</p>
<section id="task-b3" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="task-b3">Bonus task (Lesson 7)</h4>
<p>Your task for this lesson is to review some material on ggplot to connect the ideas from the previous lesson to the concept of the grammar of graphics to prepare you for starting to learn the details in the next lesson. There are a few multiple choice questions to answer in this week’s task repository.</p>
<p>In addition, I suggest the following reading with nothing to submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browse the <a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/">R graph gallery</a> to explore the huge variety of visualiaations you can make with R. Practice thinking about how the language of aesthetic mappings, geometries, and scales can be used to describe these visualizations.</li>
<li>Read through the ggplot <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf">cheatsheet</a> to see how the concepts of the grammar of graphics will be connected to computer code. Don’t worry about the details – you will practice making visualizations using these tools over many future lessons.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="task-b4" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="task-b4">Bonus task (Lesson 8)</h4>
<p>Practice using ggplot to make graphs by reproducing examples from mini-lecture or notes, and modifying them by changing variables used in aesthetic mappings. If you would like, use other data sources described in “Data Sources” chapter in course notes.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
<p>Assignments are opportunities to apply and combine the skills from several lessons. They are both structured, in that you are asked to use specific skills to accomplish a task, and creative in that you have some flexibility in the product you produce. You will be assessed on your use of technical skills and your judgement in making well-designed and effective visualizations, following the principles explored in the course.</p>
<section id="assignment-1" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="assignment-1">Assignment 1</h3>
<p>Your assignment is to get the repositories for Assignments and Tasks on to your computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your <a href="https://github.com">github</a> account and look for a repository called <code>data-viz-assignments-</code> followed by your github user name. Get the link by clicking the green button labeled “Code”. It should look like this: <code>https://github.com/Dalhousie-AndrewIrwin-Teaching/data-viz-assignments-&lt;your github name&gt;.git</code></li>
<li>Using Rstudio on your computer, select menu File &gt; New Project &gt; From repository… &gt; Git. Insert the link to the repository and tell R where to put the repository on your computer.</li>
<li>If you use rstudio.cloud, start at the <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/projects">projects</a> page and choose New Project from git repository (pop-up menu) or open your existing project for our course. Clone the github repository in your project using the terminal window and type the command <code>git clone &lt;link from github&gt;</code>. Finally, open the new folder in the Files pane and click on the “assignments.Rproj” link to switch to the project. You may be asked by rstudio.cloud to link to your github account to access private repositories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat these steps, changing <code>assignments</code> to <code>tasks</code> to get the repository with your Tasks.</p>
<p>Open the Assignments project and edit <code>assignment-1.Rmd</code>. Follow the instructions in that file. If you have trouble with this assignment, ask for help. It’s very important.</p>
<p>Use the assignment repository for this work and all assignments in the course.</p>
<p>If, when you try to push your work back to github, you get an error “Author identity unknown”, you need to type the following two commands into the R Terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>you@example.com</code> and <code>Your Name</code> with your email address and your name. Keep the quotation marks.</p>

<section id="assignment-2" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="assignment-2">Assignment 2</h3>
<p>There are so many packages and functions to make visualizations, that its really important to be able to read documentation and learn new functions. Fortunately, the design of ggplot means that many functions work very similarly and so once you have learned the basics, it’s quite easy to learn more on your own.</p>
<p>The purpose of this assignment is for you to practice this sort of learning. I’ve picked out a few functions that work much like the examples we’ve looked at already. Your assignment is to pick out two of these and make a R markdown document describing how they work. This is the sort of practice I do all the time when I learn a new R skill.</p>
<p>Look in the file <code>assignment-2.Rmd</code> for a template for this assignment.</p>
</section>
<section id="assignment-3" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="assignment-3">Assignment 3</h3>
<p>Practice using methods developed in the course so far (summarizing, ggplot visualizations, linear regression, smooths) to explore a data set and answer questions about the data.</p>
</section>
<section id="assignment-4" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="assignment-4">Assignment 4</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">Tidy Tuesday</a> is a weekly activity to support people learning to use R for data analysis and visualization. Each week a new dataset is posted and interested participants post their visualizations. Some are complex pieces of work by people with lots of experience, but many are the work of beginners just learning to make good visualizations. I encourage you to explore the datasets and example visualizations others have made as a source of ideas and inspiration.</p>
<p>For the next two assignments, I’ll select a few datasets and ask you to work with one of those for your assignment.</p>
<p>For this assignment you will make scatter plots with smooths (linear, loess, or gam) and dimensionality reduction (PCA or MDS). The goal is to gain some insight into the data and present some aspect of the data in a visually appealing way. You may be able to use the data as its presented, or you may need to transform it in some way first (for example using the dplyr tools). You should feel free to show a subset of the data if you think that makes a better visualization to highlight a particular feature of the data.</p>
<p>Present your work as a short R markdown report. You should describe the dataset, explain any analysis or transformations you did, present at least 2 visualizations, and describe the main messages conveyed by your visualization. Full instructions are in the repostory.</p>
</section>
<section id="assignment-5" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="assignment-5">Assignment 5</h3>
<p>This is the second Tidy Tuesday assignment. Create maps as described in the repository.</p>
<p>Organize your work as a slide presentation. A template with instructions is in the repository.</p>
</section>
<section id="assignment-6" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="assignment-6">Assignment 6</h3>
<p>This is a peer evaluation assignment. You should provide, in separate documents as described in the repository,</p>
<ul>
<li>confidential feedback on your team mates’ work for the term project</li>
<li>a peer evaluation of two oral presentations from other teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should provide thoughtful and constructive feedback on the work of your classmates. Everyone’s work has good aspects and areas where there could be improvement; you should aim to provide useful feedback in both areas.</p>
<p>Your assignment for the peer evaluation is in the Teams tab of this website.</p>
<p>A rubric and guide for your evaluations is in the repository for this assignment.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="project-description" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="project-description">Term project</h2>
<p>Your final project is an analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. You can choose the data based on your interests, based on work in other courses, or independent research projects. You should demonstrate many of the techniques from the course, applying them as appropriate to develop and communicate insight into the data.</p>
<p>You should create compelling visualizations of your data. Pay attention to your presentation: neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in RStudio using R.</p>
<section id="deliverables" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
<p>Work in groups of 2 or 3 according to the assignments made in <a href="./teams.html">late October</a>. You can produce team products, or one product per team member, whichever you prefer. You have two roles in the project. First you will contribute your original creative work for the project. Second, you will act as a collaborator, providing your teammates with feedback, suggestions, debugging help, proofreading and other assistance as requested.</p>
<p>Use a single GitHub repository for the proposal, presentation, and final report. Use the repository I created for your team. See the notes on collaboration with GitHub for guidance. Contact me if you have trouble.</p>
</section>
<section id="team-creation" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="team-creation">Team creation</h3>
<p>Teams will be created in October. If you would like to form a team with someone else in the class, edit the team-planning.Rmd document in the Tasks repository to add your request. If you would like to be assigned a randomly selected team mate, there will be a way to indicate that too. The deadline for selecting teammates will be Sunday 16 October. I will review this list, finalize the team assignments, create the presentation schedule and peer-evaluation assignments later that week.</p>
<p><strong>If you withdraw from the course once you have been assigned to a team for the term project, please let your teammates and me know as soon as possible.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="proposal" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="proposal">Proposal</h3>
<p>Your main task for the proposal is to find a data set to analyze for your project and describe at least one question you can address with data visualizations.</p>
<p>It is important that you choose a readily accessible data set that is large enough so multiple relationships can be explored, but no so complex that you get lost. I suggest your data set should have at least 50 observations and about 10 variables. If you find a bigger data set, you can make a subset to work with for your project. The data set should include categorical and quantitative variables. If you plan to use a data set that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into R as this can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late.</p>
<p>Do not reuse data sets from any part of the course.</p>
<p>Here is list of data repositories containing many interesting data sets. Feel free to use data from other sources if you prefer.</p>

<li>Other sources listed in the Data sources section of the course notes</li>
<li>Data you find on your own may be suitable too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Describe a data set and question you can address with the data for your proposal. Outline a plan to use five visualizations (e.g., data overview plot, dplyr/table summary, small multiples, smoothing/regression, k-means/PCA, map).</p>
<p>The repository contains a template for your proposal called <code>proposal.Rmd</code>. Write your proposal by revising this file and using this template.</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions: The introduction should introduce your research questions</li>
<li>Data: Describe the data (where it came from, how it was collected, what are the cases, what are the variables, etc.). Place your data in the /data folder. Show that you can read the data and include the output of <code>dplyr::glimpse()</code> or <code>skimr::skim()</code> on your data in the proposal.</li>
<li>Visualization plan:
<ul>
<li>The outcome (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question.</li>
<li>Ideas for at least two possible visualizations for exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data.</li>
<li>An idea of how at least one statistical method described in the course (smoothing, PCA, k-means) could be useful in analyzing your data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Team planning: briefly describe how members of your team will divide the tasks to be performed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Assessment</em>. See the file grade-proposal.rmd for the assessment guidelines and rubric.</p>
</section>
<section id="oral-presentation" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="oral-presentation">Oral presentation</h3>
<p>The oral presentation should be about 5 minutes long. The goal is to present the highlights of your project and allow for feedback which can be incorporated as you revise your written report.</p>
<p>You should have a small number of slides to accompany your presentation. I have provided a template for you to use as <code>presentation.qmd</code>. I suggest a format such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A title with team members’ names</li>
<li>A description of the data you are analyzing</li>
<li>At least one question you can investigate with your data visualization</li>
<li>At least two data visualizations</li>
<li>A conclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>For suggestions on making slide presentations see the lesson on slides.</p>
<p>Don’t show your R code; the focus should be on your results and visualizations not your computing. Set <code>echo = FALSE</code> to hide R code (this is already done in the template).</p>
<p>Your presentation should not just be an account of everything you tried (“then we did this, then we did this, etc.”), instead it should convey what choices you made, and why, and what you found.</p>
<p>Presentation schedule: Presentations will take place during the last two synchronous sessions of the course. You can choose to do your presentation live or pre-record it. You will watch presentations from other teams and provide feedback on one each day in the form of peer evaluations. The presentation schedule will be generated randomly.</p>
<p><em>Assessment</em>. See the file <code>grade-presentation.Rmd</code> for the assessment guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Practice your presentation, as a team, using the course collaborate room or other videoconferencing tool!</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="written-report" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="written-report">Written report</h3>
<p>Follow the template provided for your written report (<code>report.Rmd</code>) to present your visualizations and insights about your data. Review the marking guidelines in grade-report.rmd and ask questions if any of the expectations are unclear.</p>
<p>Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your tables and visualizations are properly formatted.</p>
<p>You and your teammate will be using the same repository, so merge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that’s fine! Pull work from github before you start, commit your changes, and push often. Ask questions when stuck. Look at the lesson on collaboration for help.</p>
<p>In your knitted report your R code should be hidden (<code>echo = FALSE</code>) so that your document is neat and easy to read. However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your R Markdown file I will obtain the results you presented. If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you’re welcome to show that portion.</p>
<p>General criteria for evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content - What is the quality of research question and relevancy of data to those questions?</li>
<li>Correctness - Are visualization procedures carried out and explained correctly?</li>
<li>Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the visualizations, writing, and explanations?</li>
<li>Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?</li>
</ul>
